# Inspector

## What is inspector?
Welcome to my submission for hackducky. Inspector is essentially a fake virus prank that starts off by sending a number of colored messages in the powershell terminal to prank the user, then starts making a few beeps through the terminal, and finally spams a bunch of edge browser tabs (but hopefully not too many, not nearly enough to cause a crash). 

## Why is it named Inspector, then?
While the virus prank is running, the main functionality of inspector is actually covertly running in the background. The script downloads a file that I made, visible as inspector.py in the root directory, that takes a number of non-sensitive information about the host computer and puts it on a online pastebin. The intended use of this functionality is to keep a running journal or log of everyone who you have pranked in the past.
